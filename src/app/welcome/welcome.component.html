        <p>Checklist files to be displayed on your EFIS screen.</p>
        <p>
          Files are edited in a common interface, and then adapted for each avionics system when they're downloaded. For
          instance, if you download checklists for an avionics system that can only display 40 columns of text, lines
          will be wrapped at 40 columns.
        </p>
        <p>Currently supported import/export formats:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Garmin G3X&trade;/GTN&trade; (.ace)</li>
          <li>Dynon SkyView&trade; - multiple width options (.txt))</li>
          <li>Advanced Flight Systems (.afd)</li>
          <li>Grand Rapids Technology (.txt)</li>
          <li>Boeing ForeFlight (.{{ FOREFLIGHT_FILE_EXTENSION }})</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not all avionics systems support all the features of this editor.</p>

      Not all formats can represent entered items in the same way! Do check that the checklists are complete and appear
      as you expected when converting between formats.<br />
      Specifically, the ForeFlight format supports:
      <ul>
        <li>Only 3 pre-set group category types (Normal, Abnormal, Emergency)</li>
        <li>
          Title, Challenge, Challenge/Response and Note to Challenge/Response (exactly 1 level indent) checklist item
          types
        </li>
      </ul>
      Other items will be silently ignored when exporting the checklist file!
